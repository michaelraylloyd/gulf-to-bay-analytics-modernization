## How to Use This Documentation

Each document is designed to stand alone with its own header.  
When assembling composite documents (e.g., executive summaries or presentations), copy the content but **remove or downgrade** the top‑level `#` headers to maintain clean hierarchy.

This index remains the authoritative navigation point for the Lakehouse Expansion documentation suite.
