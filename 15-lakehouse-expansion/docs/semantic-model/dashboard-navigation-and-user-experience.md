## Purpose

Navigation and UX standards provide:

- Clear pathways from summary to detail  
- Reduced cognitive load  
- Faster insight discovery  
- A consistent analytical workflow  

These patterns ensure that dashboards feel cohesive and professionally designed.

## Navigation Structure

### Top‑Level Summary Page
Every dashboard begins with a high‑level summary page containing:

- Primary KPIs  
- Key trends  
- High‑impact visuals  
- Immediate context for decision‑makers  

This page answers the question: *“How are we performing right now?”*

---

### Drill‑Down Pages
Users can navigate from summary metrics into deeper analytical pages.

**Examples:**  
- Sales → Product Performance  
- Sales → Customer Segments  
- Sales → Regional Trends  

Each drill‑down page focuses on a single analytical theme.

---

### Detail Pages
Detail pages provide granular, table‑level data for exploration.

**Characteristics:**  
- High‑density tables  
- Export‑friendly layouts  
- Filters aligned with dimension hierarchies  

These pages support analysts who need deeper investigation.

---

## UX Patterns

### Consistent Page Layouts
All dashboards follow a predictable structure:

- KPIs at the top  
- Trends in the middle  
- Breakdowns at the bottom  
- Filters on the left or right side  

This reduces learning time and improves usability.

---

### Guided Exploration
Dashboards use:

- Buttons  
- Bookmarks  
- Drill‑through actions  
- Hierarchical navigation  

These features guide users through the analytical story.

---

### Contextual Filters
Filters are:

- Business‑friendly  
- Consistently placed  
- Applied across all pages  
- Aligned with dimension hierarchies  

Users always know how their view is being filtered.

---

### Visual Consistency
Dashboards maintain:

- Standard color palettes  
- Consistent KPI formatting  
- Uniform chart types  
- Predictable labeling  

This creates a cohesive, professional experience.

---

## Accessibility Considerations

- High‑contrast color options  
- Clear font sizes  
- Minimal reliance on color alone  
- Logical tab order for keyboard navigation  

Accessibility is a core part of the UX strategy.

---

## Performance‑Aware Navigation

- Limit cross‑page dependencies  
- Use aggregated Gold tables  
- Avoid excessive drill‑through chains  
- Keep visuals per page manageable  

Navigation must remain fast and responsive.
