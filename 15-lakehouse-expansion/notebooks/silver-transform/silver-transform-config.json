# silver-transform-config.json

This configuration file defines the input paths, output paths, write behavior, and schema reference for the Silver transformation process. It externalizes all environment‑specific values to ensure that the Silver notebook and the pipeline‑ready script execute consistently across development and automated orchestration environments.

The configuration aligns with the Lakehouse refinement standards by separating logic from parameters, enabling deterministic and reproducible Silver transformations.
