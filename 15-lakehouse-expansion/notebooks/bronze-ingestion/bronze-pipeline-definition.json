# bronze-pipeline-definition.json

This pipeline definition orchestrates the Bronze ingestion process for the Lakehouse. It references the ingestion script, schema, and configuration files to ensure deterministic, repeatable processing of raw data into the Bronze layer.

The pipeline is modular and environment‑agnostic, making it suitable for execution within any orchestration framework, including Databricks Jobs, Fabric Pipelines, Airflow, or other enterprise schedulers. All paths, parameters, and retry behaviors are explicitly defined to support reliable automation and operational transparency.
