# gold-modeling-config.json

This configuration file defines the input Silver dataset, the output locations for each Gold dimension and fact table, and the write behavior for the star‑schema modeling process. It externalizes all environment‑specific values to ensure that the Gold modeling notebook and the pipeline‑ready script execute consistently across development and automated orchestration environments.

The configuration aligns with the Lakehouse modeling standards by separating logic from parameters, enabling deterministic and reproducible Gold transformations.
