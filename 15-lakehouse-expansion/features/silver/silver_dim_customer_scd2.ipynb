    "# Silver Dimension — Customer SCD2 Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook applies Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 logic to maintain historical accuracy for the customer dimension within the Lakehouse Expansion pillar. It detects new and changed records, generates row-level hashes for comparison, assigns effective dating, and appends updated records into the Silver dimension table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is consolidated into a single execution block to maintain clarity, reproducibility, and operational consistency across environments. This pattern ensures that downstream analytics and reporting layers always reflect accurate historical state."
