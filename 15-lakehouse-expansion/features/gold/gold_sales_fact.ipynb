    "This notebook produces the curated Gold‑layer fact table for sales. It aggregates the Silver sales dataset into daily metrics, including total sales amount and total order count. The workflow is consolidated into a single execution block to maintain clarity, reproducibility, and operational consistency across environments. This Gold fact table serves as a foundational dataset for dashboards, KPIs, and executive‑level reporting within the Lakehouse Expansion pillar."
