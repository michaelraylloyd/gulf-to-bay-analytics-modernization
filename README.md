# 👋 Hi, I'm Michael Lloyd  
### I modernize analytics systems from legacy on‑prem to clean, cloud‑ready architectures.

I’m a Business Intelligence Developer who builds end‑to‑end analytics ecosystems — from SQL pipelines to cloud orchestration to semantic models and dashboards. My work blends engineering discipline, modernization strategy, and clear documentation to create BI platforms that scale.

My flagship project, **Gulf to Bay Analytics**, is a full modernization narrative showing how SQL Server, SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS evolve into Azure Data Factory, Microsoft Fabric, Python ETL, Power BI, and Power Automate.

### 🔧 What I Build
- Metadata‑driven ETL pipelines (Python, SQL, SSIS → Fabric)
- Cloud‑ready architectures (Azure SQL, Data Lake, Fabric)
- Semantic models (SSAS → Power BI)
- Automated refresh pipelines (ADF → Fabric → Power Automate)
- Clean, documented, reproducible BI ecosystems

### 📌 Featured Project
