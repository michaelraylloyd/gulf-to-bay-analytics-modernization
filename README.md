# Gulf to Bay Analytics — End‑to‑End Modernization of the Enterprise BI Ecosystem

## 🏷️ Overview

Gulf to Bay Analytics is a full‑stack modernization initiative transforming a legacy Microsoft BI environment into a clean, automated, cloud‑aligned analytics platform. This repository reflects the complete modernization lifecycle — from SQL Server and SSIS to Fabric Data Factory, Databricks, Python ETL, semantic modeling, and automated reporting.

The structure, documentation, and SDLC workflow are intentionally designed to mirror real‑world enterprise engineering practices.

## 🧭 Navigation

This repository is organized into modular domains representing the modernization journey:

- **01‑azure-data-factory** — Legacy ADF pipelines  
- **02‑fabric-data-factory** — Modern Fabric orchestration  
- **03‑sql-server** — SQL logic, schema, and metadata  
- **04‑python** — Python ETL pipelines  
- **05‑r** — R analytics and modeling  
- **06‑databricks** — Spark notebooks and lakehouse transformations  
- **07‑dataverse** — Dataverse schema and integrations  
- **08‑ssis** — Legacy SSIS packages  
- **09‑ssas** — Tabular model artifacts  
- **10‑ssrs** — Legacy reporting assets  
- **11‑power-bi** — PBIX files, DAX, M scripts  
- **12‑power-automate** — Automated flows  
- **13‑power-apps** — Application components  
- **14‑powershell** — SDLC automation and Dev→Prod pipeline  
- **assets** — Icons and branding  
- **docs** — Architecture and modernization documentation  

Each folder includes an auto‑generated README describing its purpose and role in the modernization effort.

## 🧱 Architecture at a Glance

- **On‑Prem Foundations:** SQL Server, SSIS, SSAS, SSRS  
- **Modern Cloud ETL:** Azure Data Factory → Fabric Data Factory → Databricks  
- **Python & R Pipelines:** Modular ETL and analytics workflows  
- **Semantic Modeling:** SSAS Tabular → Power BI  
- **Automation:** Power Automate refresh orchestration  
- **Documentation:** Auto‑generated folder READMEs and modernization notes  

This repository serves as both a technical implementation and a narrative artifact — demonstrating not just *what* was modernized, but *why* each step matters.

## 🚀 Modernization Storyline

1. Assess the legacy BI ecosystem  
2. Modularize SQL logic and metadata  
3. Migrate ETL from SSIS to Python, Fabric, and Databricks  
4. Rebuild semantic models for Power BI  
5. Automate refreshes and deployments  
6. Document the modernization journey with clarity and intent  

The repo is structured to help engineers, recruiters, and hiring managers follow the modernization arc end‑to‑end.
