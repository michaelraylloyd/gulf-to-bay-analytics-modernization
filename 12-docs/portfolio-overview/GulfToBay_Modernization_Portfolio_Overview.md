# Gulf to Bay Analytics — End‑to‑End BI Modernization  
### Portfolio Overview — Michael Lloyd, Business Intelligence Developer

---

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a visual, narrative walkthrough of the **Gulf to Bay Analytics Modernization Project**, demonstrating how a legacy Microsoft BI ecosystem was transformed into a clean, automated, cloud‑aligned analytics platform.

---

## 2. Legacy Environment Overview

The original environment ran on a traditional Microsoft BI stack — SQL Server, SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS — with manual refreshes, tightly coupled ETL packages, and fragmented logic spread across multiple tools. Pipelines lacked automation, documentation was minimal, and changes often required hands‑on intervention. The system worked, but it wasn’t scalable, cloud‑ready, or easy to maintain.

<details>
<summary><strong>Expanded Legacy Environment Overview</strong></summary>

The original Gulf to Bay Analytics environment operated on a traditional on‑premises Microsoft BI stack. While it delivered essential reporting, the architecture had accumulated technical debt over time and lacked the automation and scalability expected in a modern analytics platform.

Key characteristics included:

- **SQL Server** as the central data store, with business logic spread across stored procedures, views, and ad‑hoc scripts  
- **SSIS packages** responsible for nightly ETL, tightly coupled to server paths and sensitive to schema changes  
- **SSAS Tabular models** that required manual processing and lacked clear lineage back to source systems  
- **SSRS reports** maintained independently, each with its own datasets and refresh patterns  

Operational challenges:

- **Manual refresh cycles** requiring hands‑on intervention  
- **Fragmented pipelines** with duplicated logic across SQL, SSIS, and SSAS  
- **Limited automation**, making deployments slow and error‑prone  
- **Minimal documentation**, complicating onboarding and troubleshooting  
- **Tight coupling to on‑prem infrastructure**, limiting scalability and modernization options
