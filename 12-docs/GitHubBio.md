# 🧩 GitHub Profile README (Portfolio‑Grade)

# 👋 Hi, I'm Michael Lloyd  
### I modernize analytics systems from legacy on‑prem to clean, cloud‑ready architectures.

I’m a Business Intelligence Developer who builds end‑to‑end analytics ecosystems — from SQL pipelines to cloud orchestration to semantic models and dashboards. My work blends engineering discipline, modernization strategy, and clear documentation to create BI platforms that scale.

My flagship project, **Gulf to Bay Analytics**, is a full modernization narrative showing how SQL Server, SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS evolve into Azure Data Factory, Microsoft Fabric, Python ETL, Power BI, and Power Automate.

### 🔧 What I Build
- Metadata‑driven ETL pipelines (Python, SQL, SSIS → Fabric)
- Cloud‑ready architectures (Azure SQL, Data Lake, Fabric)
- Semantic models (SSAS → Power BI)
- Automated refresh pipelines (ADF → Fabric → Power Automate)
- Clean, documented, reproducible BI ecosystems

### 📌 Featured Project

# 💼 LinkedIn “About” Section (Modernization‑Aligned)

I design and modernize analytics systems that help organizations move from legacy BI to scalable, cloud‑ready architectures. My work spans SQL Server, SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS all the way to Azure Data Factory, Microsoft Fabric, Python ETL, Power BI, and Power Automate.

I specialize in rebuilding traditional BI ecosystems into clean, automated pipelines with strong documentation, metadata‑driven design, and production‑grade engineering practices. My flagship project — **Gulf to Bay Analytics** — is a full modernization narrative that demonstrates how an on‑prem Microsoft BI stack evolves into a modern analytics platform.

I enjoy solving real‑world data challenges, designing semantic models, building automated refresh pipelines, and creating BI systems that are maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand.

If you're looking for someone who can bridge legacy systems with modern cloud analytics — and communicate the journey clearly — that’s where I do my best work.
