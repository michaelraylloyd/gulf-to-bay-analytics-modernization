# GTB Equipment Requests

This folder is part of the Gulf to Bay Analytics modernization project.  
It contains assets, scripts, or resources related to the **GTB Equipment Requests Power App**, aligned with the overall goal of creating a clean, automated, cloud‑ready analytics ecosystem.

## Purpose

This folder contributes to the modernization effort by organizing work related to **equipment request submission, approval workflows, and operational visibility** in a clear, maintainable structure. The app provides a streamlined interface for employees to submit requests and for approvers to review, approve, or reject them.

## Contents

This folder may include:
- Unpacked Power Apps source (`GTB_EquipmentRequests.json`)
- Screen definitions for Pending Approvals, Request Details, Edit Request, and Dashboard views
- App‑level configuration and metadata
- Supporting assets, themes, and documentation

## Application Behavior

The GTB Equipment Requests app supports a complete request lifecycle:

- **Pending Approvals Home Screen** — The app opens directly to a gallery of pending requests, allowing approvers to quickly see what needs attention.
- **Gallery‑Driven Navigation** — Selecting an item in the gallery opens a dedicated **Details** page showing all request information in a clean, structured layout.
- **Edit Request Screen** — Approvers can approve or reject a request from the edit screen. Requesters can update their own submissions or cancel changes.
- **New Request Screen** — Users can submit new equipment requests with required fields and validation.
- **Dashboard Experience** — A two‑page dashboard provides:
  - A high‑level KPI summary
  - A detailed breakdown of request statuses, categories, and trends

## Modernization Context

As part of the end‑to‑end modernization, this folder helps ensure:
- Clean separation of UI, logic, and assets  
- Improved maintainability through unpacked source control  
- Consistent documentation across Power Platform components  
- Recruiter‑ready project organization that demonstrates modern Power Apps engineering practices
