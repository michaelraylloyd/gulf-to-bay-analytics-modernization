# Gulf to Bay Analytics — End‑to‑End BI Modernization  
### Portfolio Overview — Michael Lloyd, Business Intelligence Developer

---

## Executive Summary

This portfolio showcases the complete modernization of Gulf to Bay Analytics from a fragmented, on‑prem Microsoft BI stack into a unified, cloud‑native analytics ecosystem built on Microsoft Fabric. The transformation spans SQL Server, SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS through Azure SQL, Lakehouse medallion architecture, Python ETL, Fabric Data Factory pipelines, a rebuilt Power BI semantic model, automated refreshes via Power Automate, and Power Apps for operational workflows. The project also includes a fully restructured Git‑based SDLC with feature branching, Dev/Main separation, and deterministic promotion patterns that mirror real enterprise engineering practices. This document provides a visual, narrative walkthrough of that journey, supported by architecture diagrams, screenshots, and detailed modernization notes.
